1.	Title:  Module 10 Challenge-SQLAlchemy

2.	Description:  The focus of the Module 10 Challenge is learning the interaction of the web and client-server architecture through the use of SQLAlchemy, SQLite, and Flask. Define endpoints and extract query variables path to perform a climate analysis and generate the code needed to answer questions about the data. Analyzing data and designing a Climate App will be required to successfully complete the module. The following are the key areas covered:

a.	Analyze and Explore Climate Data
    i.	 Use Python and SQLAlchemy to analyze climate data 
    ii.	 Use the SQLAlchemy (create_engine() function to connect to SQLite database
    iii. Use the automap_base() function to reflect tables into classes
    iv.	 Link Python to the database by creating a SQLAlchemy session.
    v.	 Perform a Precipitation Analysis
    vi.	 Perform a Station Analysis

b.	Design a Climate App
    i.	 Design a Flask API
    ii.	 Create and list all available routes
    iii. Convert query results to a dictionary
    iv.	 Use JSON to represent the dictionary
    v.	 Perform queries of dates and temperatures


c.	Data Analysis
i.	Using SQL, SQLAlchemy, SQLite, and ORM, provide answers to the Analyze and Design Climate Questions

3.	Usage

a)	The SQLAlchemy-Challenge file will have a SurfsUp folder that contains Jupyter notebook and app.py file. In addition, there will be a Resources folder, which contains the data files needed for the challenge. 
b)	In order to achieve the coding outputs described above, the script sequencing for the SQLAlchemy-Challenge requirements are as follows:
    i.	 Import required file dependencies
    ii.	 Create an engine that will connect to the SQLite database.
    iii. Use the automap_base() function to reflect tables into classes.
    iv.	 Link Python to the database by creating a SQLAlchemy session.

4.	Dependencies
a.	Importing the correct files, connecting to the SQL database, and performing the required SQL queries is critical to enable code execution. 
b.	Creating the Python classes and objects

5.	Known Issues: Issues with the script.
a.	There were no know issues with the script that I am aware of.
